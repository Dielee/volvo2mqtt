This component establishes a connection between the newer AAOS Volvo cars and Home Assistant via MQTT.<br>
Maybe this component works also with other Volvo cars. Please try out the native Volvo [integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/volvooncall/) before using this component! If the native component doesn't work for your car, try this mqtt bridge.
<p>

Home Assistant thread can be found [here](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/volvo2mqtt-connect-your-aaos-volvo/585699).

<b>Important note: The Volvo api currently ONLY works in these [countries](https://developer.volvocars.com/terms-and-conditions/apis-supported-locations/)</b>

## OTP Authentication

As of version <b>v1.9.0</b>, this addon uses the same OTP authentication as the Volvo app. 
The following steps are required for authentication in exactly this order:

1. Setup volvo2Mqtt, either via Docker, or via HA addon (take a look at the "Setup" section below)
2. Fill in your settings and start volvo2Mqtt
3. Your log will show the following lines <br> 
```Waiting for otp code... Please check your mailbox and post your otp code to the following mqtt topic "volvoAAOS2mqtt/otp_code". Retry 0/15```<br>
```Waiting for otp code... Please check your mailbox and post your otp code to the following mqtt topic "volvoAAOS2mqtt/otp_code". Retry 1/15```<br>
```etc ...```
4. Now, open your mailbox and copy your OTP Code
5. Open HomeAssistant and search for the entity ID ```text.volvo_otp```
6. Paste your OTP into the text entity and **<ins>press Enter</ins>**<br>
   6a. (optional) If your OTP cannot be safed, try to paste your OTP code via MQTT to the following topic: `volvoAAOS2mqtt/otp_code` <p>
       <details>
             <summary>OTP Post Script</summary>
             <div>
                <p>
                1. Safe the following script in your script section <br>
                2. Go to https://yourHAUrl/developer-tools/service<br>
                3. Search for "Post Volvo OTP"<br>
                4. Tick "OTP" and fill in your OTP<br>
                5. Run this service<br>
             </div>
       
            alias: Post Volvo OTP
            sequence:
              - service: mqtt.publish
                metadata: {}
                data:
                  topic: volvoAAOS2mqtt/otp_code
                  payload: "{{ otp }}"
            mode: single
            fields:
              otp:
                selector:
                  text: null
                name: OTP
                description: Volvo OTP
   
   </details>
8. If everything has worked, your addon is now authenticated. In the future, OTP authentication only needs to be done when updating, not when restarting the container.

## Setup
<b>Docker:</b>

Just install this addon with the following command.
Please note to fill in your settings inside the environment variables.

`docker run -d --pull=always -e CONF_updateInterval=300 -e CONF_babelLocale='de' -e CONF_mqtt='@json {"broker": "", "username": "", "password": "", "port": 1883}' -e CONF_volvoData='@json {"username": "", "password": "", "vin": "", "vccapikey": ["key1", "key2"]}' -e TZ='Europe/Berlin' --name volvo2mqtt ghcr.io/dielee/volvo2mqtt:latest`
